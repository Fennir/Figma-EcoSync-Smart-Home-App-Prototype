# Figma-EcoSync-Smart-Home-App-Prototype
 Created a prototype app for smart home management, emphasizing energy efficiency and comprehensive control of household appliances.

UI/UX Design: Designed user-friendly interfaces using Figma, focusing on intuitive navigation and energy-efficient controls.
My team have prepared a blog to showcase all our deliverables including survey, analysis, the prototype environment and demo video. Forstudy purpose, the prototype is free to edit once you duplicate it.
